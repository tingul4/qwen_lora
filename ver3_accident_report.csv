   - Another car is 13.5 meters away and approaching with a Time-to-Collision of 19.6 seconds. This vehicle is also in the same lane, further increasing the risk.

3. **Collision Course (TTC=2.1s)**
   - A motorcycle is 8.3 meters away and approaching with a Time-to-Collision of 2.1 seconds. This vehicle is in the same lane and is likely to be in a collision course with the ego vehicle.

4. **Proximity Warning (16.9m, Approaching)**
   - A motorcycle is 16.9 meters away and approaching with a Time-to-Collision of 15.3 seconds. This vehicle is in the same lane and is approaching closely.

5. **Proximity Warning (7.8m, Approaching)**
   - Another motorcycle is 7.8 meters away and approaching with a Time-to-Collision of 2.8 seconds. This vehicle is in the same lane and is approaching closely.

6. **Proximity Warning (19.5m, Approaching)**
   - A motorcycle is 19.5 meters away and approaching with a Time-to-Collision of 13.3 seconds. This vehicle is in the same lane and is approaching closely.

7. **Proximity Warning (9.7m, Approaching)**
   - A motorcycle is 9.7 meters away and approaching with a Time-to-Collision of 5.8 seconds. This vehicle is in the same lane and is approaching closely.

Task: Generate a risk assessment report warning the driver.","### Risk Assessment Report

#### Summary
The current driving situation involves multiple vehicles on the road, with the ego vehicle approaching a truck that is in a collision course. The risk assessment is as follows:

1. **Current Situation:**
   - **Ego Vehicle:** Moving forward.
   - **Truck 1:** Approaching from the front, 8.8m away with a Time-to-Collision (TTC) of 1.0s.
   - **Truck 2:** Approaching from the front, 17.5m away with a TTC of 29.3s.
   - **Car:** Receding from the rear, 5.8m away with a TTC of Safe.

2. **Risk Analysis:**
   - **Immediate Risk:** The truck in front (1.0s TTC) is in a collision course with the ego vehicle. This poses a high risk of collision if the ego vehicle does not react promptly.
   - **Medium Risk:** The truck approaching from the front (29.3s TTC) is a potential risk if it continues to approach at the current rate.
   - **Low Risk:** The car receding from the rear (5.8m TTC) is not a significant risk as it is moving away.

3. **Recommended Actions:**
   - **Immediate Action:** Apply the brakes to decelerate and avoid the collision with the truck in front.
   - **Long-term Strategy:** Maintain a safe distance from the approaching truck and be prepared to react to any sudden changes in its behavior.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The primary risk is the truck in front, which is in a collision course with the ego vehicle. Immediate action is required to avoid a collision.
