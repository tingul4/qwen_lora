road_0017,1,"Scene Description: Foggy mountain road with narrow, winding lanes.

Risk Level: Critical (Collision Occurred)

Key Hazards:

Lane Departure (Wrong-Way Driving): A black sedan crosses the double yellow line into the opposing lane.

Blind Curve/Fog: Limited visibility makes it difficult for oncoming traffic to react.

Prediction: The black sedan collides head-on or sideswipes the silver car traveling in the correct lane due to reckless overtaking or loss of control on the curve."
road_0164,0,
road_0033,0,
road_0024,0,"Scene Description: Busy intersection. Two scooters are stopped in the middle of the junction, waiting for cars to pass.

Risk Level: High (Near Miss)

Key Hazards:

Intersection Loitering: Vulnerable road users (scooters) are stationary in a high-risk zone (center of the intersection).

Traffic Flow Conflict: Cars are passing in close proximity to the waiting scooters.

Prediction: A highly dangerous situation (""Close Call""), but no accident occurs as the drivers successfully navigate around the stationary scooters."

road_0119,1,
road_0007,0,"Scene Description: Daytime, rural road, rainy conditions. Following a small blue truck.

Risk Level: Medium

Key Hazards:

Slippery Surface: Rain creates a risk of hydroplaning or increased stopping distance.

Road Geometry: Slight curve in the road.

Prediction: Main risk is rear-ending the truck if it slows down for the curve on the wet asphalt."

Risk Level: Critical (Collision Occurred)

Key Hazards:

The ""Courtesy Trap"" (Suicide Gap): The stopped car obscures the view of the emerging vehicle.

Illegal Overtaking: The scooter rider grows impatient, crosses the double yellow line (opposing lane) to overtake the stopped car, unaware of the emerging vehicle.

Prediction: The scooter collides with the emerging car. The scooter rider's view was blocked (Occlusion), and the reckless overtaking maneuver into the opposing lane caused the crash."
road_0232,0,
road_0059,1,
road_0006,1,"Scene Description: Daytime urban intersection with wide lanes. The ego-vehicle is proceeding straight, and a large truck on the right is turning right.

Risk Level: Critical

Key Hazards:

Traffic Signal Violation (Red Light Running): A silver sedan enters the intersection from the left side, disregarding the traffic signal and crossing the path of the ego-vehicle and the turning truck.

Distraction/Occlusion: The large truck on the right initially draws the driver's attention, potentially distracting from the threat emerging from the left.

Prediction: High risk of a T-bone collision (Side-impact collision). The ego-vehicle must execute emergency braking immediately to avoid hitting the vehicle running the red light"

Risk Level: Medium (Safe)

Key Hazards:

Tailgating: The scooter is following the truck too closely (insufficient braking distance).

Adverse Weather: Rain reduces tire traction (Slippery road).

Prediction: High potential risk due to short following distance, but no accident occurs because the overall traffic speed is low."

Key Hazards:

Unsafe Lane Change: A car attempts to change lanes to the left.

Speed/Distance Miscalculation: The driver fails to gauge the speed of the scooter ahead or leaves insufficient following distance during the maneuver.

Prediction: The car grazes or hits the scooter in front due to poor spatial awareness during the lane change."
road_0010,0,"Scene Description: Daytime intersection. A red car is attempting to turn left while scooters are proceeding straight from the opposing direction.

Risk Level: High (Near Miss)

Key Hazards:

Unprotected Left Turn: The car turns left across the path of oncoming two-wheelers.

Gap Acceptance: The driver misjudges the gap or timing relative to the approaching scooters.

Prediction: A potential collision is narrowly avoided. The left-turning car almost sideswipes the oncoming scooter, but the low speed of both parties allows for a safe stop/evasion."
