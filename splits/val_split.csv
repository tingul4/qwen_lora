road_0009,0,"Scene Description: Daytime intersection under an overpass. A car is in the fast (inner) lane.

Risk Level: Medium (Near Miss / Traffic Violation)

Key Hazards:

Illegal Turn: A car executes a right turn from the inner (fast) lane, cutting across multiple lanes of traffic.

Defensive Driving: The nearby scooter/traffic is moving slowly enough to react.

Prediction: High risk of accident due to the car's illegal maneuver, but actual collision is avoided in this instance due to the low speed of the surrounding scooter/traffic."

road_0005,0,"Scene Description: Daytime intersection. A scooter attempts a left turn while a car approaches from the right.

Risk Level: High (Near Miss)

Key Hazards:

Negligent Turn: The scooter rider turns left without checking for cross-traffic coming from the right.

Mitigating Factor (Low Speed): Both the scooter and the approaching car are traveling at low speeds.

Prediction: A hazardous situation arises due to the scooter's failure to yield, but a collision is avoided primarily due to the low speed of both parties allowing for reaction time."
